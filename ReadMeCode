This is a machine learning project wherein we are first going through the data provided to us in the dataset to check for what are the main causes of a hear aatack and are then trying
to predict if a person with certain underlying conditions or a certain kind of lifestyle will succumb to a heart attack.
We are plotting various graphs and pie charts throughout the project to get a visual representation of how certain choices or health conditions are affecting the population.
Not only that, we are also visualizing the extent of the effect certain choices and health conditions have on males and females.
We then go on to use Logistic Regression , Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SHAP and Lime to further visualize our data and to also make predictions on the data.
We are also making use of Eli5 in the project to make our predictions.
